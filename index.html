					</blockquote>
					<cite>Mozilla Developer Network</cite>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							This is the MDN definition of reduce:
							The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and
							each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a
							single value...
						</p>
						<p>
							So reduce is built into all arrays and is a way to transform the
							array, item by item, into a new value.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to use reduce you need to supply a function to accumulate
							the values and an initial value. The initial value is optional & if
							you omit it, the first item in the array is used.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here is a simple example to sum all the numbers in a list.
						</p>

const xs = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = xs.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current, 0);
						</code>

					<span>also</span>
					<pre>
						<code>
const xs = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = xs.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current);
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In each example we're going to iterate over the array and apply
							the provided function (which is just addition) to the previous value
							and the current value. The result of that computation will be used
							as the previous value in the next iteration.
						</p>
						<p>
							The difference between the two is in the initial value that is
							provided. When ommitted, the first value in the array is used.
						</p>
						<p>
							The process can be visualized like so:
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny2.jpeg">
					<pre>
						<code>
xs.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0)
            0     1            1
            1     2            3
            3     3            6
						</code>
					</pre>
					<span>also</span>
					<pre>
						<code>
xs.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr)
            1     2            3
            3     3            6
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							In the first example, we use zero as a initial value, so 0 & 1
							(the first value in the array) are passed into our function. The
							result of adding 0 & 1 is 1 so 1 is passed as the first argument
							to the function at the next iteration. The process continues
							passing the result of the previous step into the next step until
							the list is exhausted.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second example works in the same way, but because the last
							argument was omitted, the function receives 1 & 2 at the first
							iteration.
						</p>
						<p>
							The name "prev" is a bit of a confusing name. You might think that
							it represents the result of the previous computation, but in the
							first iteration, no computation has been performed. You might then
							think that it represents the previous item in the array, but that
							is only true in the second example and only for the first
							iteration. I prefer the name "acc", short for "accumulator".

					<h2>Reduce is for combining values in an array</h2>

							Suppose you had a list of names, and you wanted to transform that

							One possible solution is to loop over the list, like so.
						</p>
						<p>
							And it totally works. Except now you've got all kinds of extra stuff
							to keep in your head. There's a counter and a bounds check. You've
							got to access each item by index. Of course this all very common

					<h2>The case against foreach</h2>

					<h3>
						Mutation
					</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">
						Purity
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Mutation
						</p>
						<p>
							The most common use of forEach is mutation; reaching into a
							collection and changing each of the values inside, which is not
							what we want. If we wanted to append the word "rocks!" to each
							name, that would be a more appropriate use of forEach
						</p>
						<p>
							Purity
						</p>
						<p>
							In this case each iteration has to reach outside of the arguments
							provided in order to work. Any time a function relies on more than
							the arguments it was given it is impure. It may not be a big deal
							in this example, but anything could happen to the target object
							before the loop runs meaning the result of the forEach isn't
							guaranteed to be the same; another trait of an impure function.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reduce, on the other hand, is pure. It only relies on the arguments
							given. Granted, in may mutate that argument but it is then used,
							in its new state, in the next iteration so the mutation is confined.
							You are, at least as much as you can be in JavaScript, guaranteed
							that it will behave the same each time you run it.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny7.jpeg">
					<h2>So what</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							The idea that reduce is just an abstract way to transform an array
							is extremely powerful. Once you begin to see it in that light, you
							realize that lots of everyday functions can be defined in terms of
							reduce
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny7.jpeg">
					<h2>Map</h2>
					<pre>
						<code>
const myMap = (fn, arr) => arr.reduce((prev, curr) => {
    prev.push(fn(curr));
    return prev;
  }, []);
						</code>
					</pre>
					<h2>Filter</h2>
					<pre>
						<code>
const myFilter = (pred, arr) => arr.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  if (pred(curr)) { acc.push(curr); }
  return acc;
}, [])
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Both map and filter can be defined as reducing from one array into
							another using push. Map simply applies a function to each value
							first, and filter only pushes those values which satisfy some
							predicate.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny8.jpg">
					<h2>But what can you do with that</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							JavaScript already has lots of built-in functions; we don't need
							to write them ourselves. What's more, they're on the Array
							prototype, so we can chain them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Suppose we had a list of numbers from 1-100, and we wanted to take
							only those divisible by 3 and then square them.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny8.jpg">
					<pre>
						<code>
oneToOneHundred
  .filter((n) => n % 3 === 0)
  .map((n) => n * n)
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							This is one option. We could use that built-in Array methods to
							filter the numbers that are divisible by 3, and then use map to
							square them.
						</p>
						<p>
							But that means we pass through the array twice. Each array function
							enumerates the values, and returns a new array. If more functions
							get chained, that's more passes through the array. That's not really
							a concern here, but might be if the array was much larger.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/kenny8.jpg">
					<pre>
						<code>
oneToOneHundred.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  if (curr % 3 === 0) {
    acc.push(curr * curr);
  }

  return acc;
}, []);
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							If you know that filter and map are just special versions of reduce
							you can use reduce to combine the two. We can check if the number
							is divisible by 3 and square it at once.

					<h4>Reduce isn't just about 'reducing' arrays</h4>
					<h4 class="fragment">Reduce is an abstraction for transforming arrays</h4>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Reduce isn't just about 'reducing' arrays; though the name and
							documentation give that impression.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reduce is just about transforming an array into a new value. That
							value might be something obviously singular like a number or string
							, but it might be an array or an object.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once we see reduce in this light, we see how it can be used to
							implement many of the more common array methods like map and
							filter.
						</p>
						<p>
							With that knowledge we can find ways to "collapse" method chains
							into a single function that combines, for example, filtering and
